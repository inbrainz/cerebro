> Mount Everest is Earth&#039;s highest mountain above sea level, elevation of 29,029ft (8,848m). It is lovated in the Himalayas, between China and Nepal. Check the picture of this amazing mountain [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Everest_kalapatthar.jpg). The 1953 British Mount Everest expedition was the 9th mountaineering expedition to attempt the first ascent of Mount Everest, and the first confirmed to have succeeded when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the summit on 29th May 1953. Did you know that the Hawaiian dormant volcano Mauna Kea is actually 33,500ft (10,200m) high from tip to peak? But it&#039;s only 13,803 ft (4,207 m) above sea level. Would you like to know more about the Seven Summits?
