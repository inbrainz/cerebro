### Output
> Bots are a software application that are programmed to do different tasks, usually repetitive actions. Bots are run according to given instructions in a much faster way than humans could. There are many different kinds of bots: good bots, such as chatbots, web crawlers or Googlebots, and social bots; and also &quot;bad&quot; or malicious bots. Believe me, you don&#039;t want to mess with those.
