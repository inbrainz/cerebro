### Output
> Life is the period between birth and death. The fact that you are here, breathing and talking to me means that you are alive. But what is the meaning of life? That&#039;s a difficult question. Many people believe there&#039;s a purpose in everyone&#039;s life and they have to find it in order to be happy, to feel fulfilled. One thing is clear: we don&#039;t know if there will be a tomorrow, so it&#039;s best to live our lives the best we can, being present and surrounded by our loved ones. I found an interesting playlist of TED Talks about life, check it [here](https://www.ted.com/playlists/246/life_is_beautiful). What would you like to talk about now?
